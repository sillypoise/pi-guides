## Quick Start

The guide system supports two bootstrap modes.

### Mode A. Personal convenience mode

Use this when the package is already available globally from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.

1. Start pi in the target repository.
2. Run:

```text
/guide-init --no-settings
```

3. Inspect the active state:

```text
/guides
```

This creates any missing:

- `.pi/guides.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

It does **not** create `.pi/settings.json`.
Use this for personal repos and quick local setup.

### Mode B. Reproducible repo mode

Use this when the repository should carry its own package pin.

1. Start pi in the target repository.
2. Run one of:

```text
/guide-init git:git@github.com:sillypoise/pi-guides@v0.1.2
```

or later, once published to npm:

```text
/guide-init npm:@sillypoise/pi-guides@0.1.2
```

3. Inspect the active state:

```text
/guides
```

This creates any missing:

- `.pi/guides.json`
- `.pi/settings.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

Use this for shared repos and any repository that needs deterministic package sourcing.

### Local development in this repo

This repository self-hosts its own package during development.

`.pi/settings.json` contains:

```json
{
  "packages": [".."]
}
```

Because `.pi/settings.json` is inside `.pi/`, the relative path `..` resolves to the repository root.
That lets pi load this local package while working in this repository.

To test unreleased package changes in another repo, use:

```text
/guide-init --dev
```

`--dev` resolves a local package path from one of:

- `PI_GUIDES_DEV_SOURCE`
- `.pi/settings.json` field `piGuidesDevSource`
- `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` field `piGuidesDevSource`

This is intended for personal testing only.
The generated `.pi/settings.json` will contain a machine-specific local path.

---

## Why this exists

OpenCode used an instruction-loading model built around a shared selector file, repo overlays, and an `instructions` array in `opencode.json`.

Pi has different native primitives:

- `AGENTS.md` for repo-local context
- extensions for deterministic runtime logic
- prompt templates for reusable task steering
- pi packages for installation and distribution

This repository adopts the pi-native model instead of trying to recreate OpenCode verbatim.

---

## Core architecture

### 1. Repo-local guide config: `.pi/guides.json`

This is the canonical machine-readable activation file.

It defines:

- active profile or direct guide list
- preferred mode (`compact` or `full`)
- explicit additions and removals
- explicit variant overrides

### 2. Repo-local prose/context: `AGENTS.md`

This remains a normal pi context file.

It is for:

- repo facts
- commands
- workflow expectations
- repo-specific constraints

It is **not** the canonical guide-selection manifest.

### 3. Package extension: `extensions/guide-system.ts`

This is the activation engine.

Pi provides the built-in extension hook `before_agent_start`.
This package implements a custom extension that subscribes to that hook.

The extension:

- reads `.pi/guides.json`
- resolves profiles using `registry/profiles.json`
- resolves guide variants using `registry/guides.json`
- loads the selected markdown guide files
- appends the resolved guide content to the effective system prompt
- exposes helper commands
- shows active guide status in the footer
- can persist profile and mode updates back into `.pi/guides.json`

### 4. Package distribution: `package.json`

This repo is a pi package repository.
It is intended to be installed:

- globally via `pi install ...`, or
- project-locally via `.pi/settings.json`

## Installation

### Recommended rollout order

1. local path during package development
2. pinned git source during early dogfooding and ansible rollout
3. pinned npm version once publishing is live

### Global install

Global install makes the extension and slash commands available everywhere.
It does **not** activate guides in a repo by itself.
A repo still needs `.pi/guides.json`.

Example global pi settings using a pinned git source:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "git:git@github.com:sillypoise/pi-guides@v0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

Equivalent npm form once published:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:@sillypoise/pi-guides@0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

You can place that in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, or install through `pi install ...`.

### Project-local install

Project-local install pins the package in the repository itself.
That is the recommended setup for shared repos.

Git example:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "git:git@github.com:sillypoise/pi-guides@v0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

Npm example once published:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:@sillypoise/pi-guides@0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

Place that in `.pi/settings.json`, or install through `pi install -l ...`.

### Local path install

For local testing:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "../path/to/pi-guides"
  ]
}
```

This is most useful while iterating on the package itself.

### Dotfiles / ansible integration

The recommended workstation split is:

- `sp-dotfiles` installs pi and writes `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
- dotfiles optionally registers this package globally at a pinned source
- repositories opt into guide activation with `.pi/guides.json`
- shared repos can additionally pin the package in `.pi/settings.json`

That means:

- global package install = guide tooling is available
- repo `.pi/guides.json` = guides are active in that repo
- repo `.pi/settings.json` = package source is reproducible in that repo

### Migration from the old OpenCode workflow

Old workflow:

- clone a shared guides repo into the workstation
- point tool config at shared instruction files
- use shell scripts to initialize and sync repo overlays

Pi-native workflow:

- install a pi package globally or per-repo
- let the extension resolve and inject active guides
- keep repo activation in `.pi/guides.json`
- keep repo context in `AGENTS.md`
- use `/guide-init` and `/guide-sync` instead of external shell scripts

This removes the runtime dependency on a manually cloned shared guide directory.

---

## Consumer repo setup walkthrough

A consuming repository should normally have three pieces:

### 1. `.pi/settings.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "git:git@github.com:sillypoise/pi-guides@v0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

This tells pi to load the package resources, including the extension.

### 2. `.pi/guides.json`

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profile": "core",
  "mode": "compact",
  "additions": [],
  "removals": [],
  "variants": {}
}
```

This is the canonical machine-readable guide selection file.

### 3. `AGENTS.md`

Generated from `templates/repo-AGENTS.md` or created manually following the same contract.

Important rule:

- `.pi/guides.json` = machine-readable guide selection
- `AGENTS.md` = human-readable repo context

---

## How activation actually works

This is the most important mental model for using the system.

### Step 1. Pi loads the package

If the package is listed in `.pi/settings.json`, pi loads the package resources declared in this repo's `package.json`.

That includes the extension in:

- `extensions/guide-system.ts`

### Step 2. The extension auto-loads

You do **not** enable the extension separately.

If the package is loaded and the extension is declared in `package.json`, the extension is active automatically.

### Step 3. The extension resolves repo guide config

On each normal agent turn, the extension:

1. reads `.pi/guides.json`
2. expands either:
   - `profile`, or
   - direct `guides`
3. applies `additions`
4. applies `removals`
5. resolves each guide to a concrete variant
6. orders guides by registry precedence
7. appends the active guide content to the effective system prompt in `before_agent_start`

### Step 4. The model sees the active guides

After that, normal prompts should behave as though the active guides are in force for that turn.

Examples:

- “review this file”
- “refactor this function”
- “rewrite this validator”

Those should use the active guide set automatically.

### Important nuance

**Extension loaded** is not exactly the same thing as **guides active**.

The correct mental model is:

- extension loaded = the guide system machinery is available
- guides active = the extension successfully resolved `.pi/guides.json` and injected guides for the current agent turn

So if:

- `/guides` shows a valid active state, and
- your next message is a normal agent prompt,

then the guides should be active for that prompt.

---

## Commands provided by the extension

### `/guides`

Shows the currently resolved guide state in a structured widget and updates footer status.

The widget includes:

- current resolved status
- config path
- active profile and mode
- active session overlay when present
- effective write policy, tool mode, and response contract
- precedence order
- config-level additions, removals, and variant overrides when present
- resolved guide entries with source paths and summaries
- available profile list

### `/guide-init [package-source] [--no-settings] [--dev]`

Scaffolds missing repo files from package templates.

By default, it creates any missing:

- `.pi/guides.json`
- `.pi/settings.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

Current v0.1 behavior:

- it does not overwrite existing files
- if the package is already available globally, plain `/guide-init` skips `.pi/settings.json` automatically
- otherwise, plain `/guide-init` writes `.pi/settings.json` using the package git tag by default
- you can pass an explicit package source, for example:
  - `/guide-init git:git@github.com:sillypoise/pi-guides@v0.1.2`
  - `/guide-init npm:@sillypoise/pi-guides@0.1.2`
- you can use `--dev` to write a configured local package path for testing unreleased changes
- `--dev` resolves from `PI_GUIDES_DEV_SOURCE` or settings field `piGuidesDevSource`
- `--dev` cannot be combined with `--no-settings` or an explicit package source
- you can skip `.pi/settings.json` generation with `--no-settings`
- `-h` and `--help` show usage guidance in the widget
- unknown options are rejected explicitly
- the widget distinguishes global-package, repo-pinned, and local-dev bootstrap modes
- the widget includes next-step hints after scaffolding
- it does not attempt complex AGENTS migrations yet

### `/guide-sync`

Refreshes only the managed header block inside `AGENTS.md`.

It will:

- create `AGENTS.md` from the template if missing
- update the managed header block if the markers are present exactly once
- report `unchanged` when the managed header already matches the package template
- refuse risky rewrites if the marker contract is missing or malformed
- render a widget summarizing the result

### `/guide-profile <profile-id>`

Persists a named profile into `.pi/guides.json` and reloads the runtime.

Current v0.1 behavior:

- profile ids come from `registry/profiles.json`
- baseline examples now include `core`, `coreplus`, `frontend`, `backend`, `docs`, and `security-sensitive`
- if the repo currently uses direct `guides`, the command switches to profile-based config
- direct-guide-only fields are dropped during that transition
- invalid profile ids are rejected explicitly
- overlay-only profiles are rejected explicitly
- a no-op write is detected and reported without reloading
- calling without arguments shows available profiles

### `/guide-mode <compact|full>`

Persists the preferred guide mode into `.pi/guides.json` and reloads the runtime.

Current v0.1 behavior:

- accepted values are `compact` and `full`
- invalid values are rejected explicitly
- a no-op write is detected and reported without reloading
- if no mode is provided, the command shows the current guide widget and explains usage

### `/guide-session <profile-id|clear>`

Activates or clears a temporary session overlay without rewriting `.pi/guides.json`.

Current v0.1 behavior:

- overlay profile ids come from `registry/profiles.json`
- baseline-only profiles are rejected explicitly
- `clear` removes the active session overlay
- built-in overlays now include `review`, `migration`, `debug`, `design`, `docs-authoring`, and `release`
- `review` sets read-only write policy and blocks `edit` and `write` tool calls
- a no-op activation is detected and reported without reloading

---

## Guide registry contract

`registry/guides.json` is the machine-canonical guide registry.

The extension reads this file at runtime.
It should not parse `VARIANTS.md`-style prose.

Each guide entry defines:

- stable guide id
- title
- precedence tier
- summary
- defaults for compact and full resolution
- available variants and their file paths

Current v0.1 registry contains only one guide family:

- `tigerstyle`

---

## Profile registry contract

`registry/profiles.json` is the machine-canonical profile registry.

Current v0.1 profile set:

- `core`

This currently expands to:

- `tigerstyle`

Profiles are intentionally simple in v0.1:

- no inheritance
- no dynamic composition rules
- no hidden expansions

---

## Resolution rules

At runtime the extension resolves guides like this:

1. Load `.pi/guides.json`
2. Expand either:
   - `profile`, or
   - direct `guides`
3. Apply `additions`
4. Apply `removals`
5. Resolve each guide to a concrete variant
6. Order resolved guides by registry precedence
7. Inject the active guide set into the system prompt in `before_agent_start`

### Variant resolution order

If `mode` is `compact`, resolution prefers:

1. `strict-compact`
2. `pragmatic-compact`
3. `strict-full`
4. `pragmatic-full`

If `mode` is `full`, resolution prefers:

1. `strict-full`
2. `pragmatic-full`
3. `strict-compact`
4. `pragmatic-compact`

Explicit `variants.<guide-id>` overrides take precedence over the mode default.

### Direct guides vs profile mode

If `.pi/guides.json` uses direct `guides`, v0.1 rejects non-empty:

- `additions`
- `removals`

That ambiguity is rejected explicitly instead of being silently ignored.

---

## Validation

Run:

```bash
./bin/validate-pi-guides
```

Current validation checks include:

- `package.json` has pi-package metadata and extension registration
- registry files are valid JSON objects using `version: 1`
- guide precedence ids and ranks are well-formed and unique
- guide defaults reference existing variants of the matching size
- guide variant paths exist
- profile guide references are valid
- template managed header markers exist exactly once and in the correct order
- local dogfood `.pi/guides.json` is valid
- local dogfood `.pi/settings.json` is valid
- key runtime files exist

The repository also includes extension command dogfood checks and validator regression checks:

```bash
node --test
```

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### I can see `/guides`, but are guides automatically active for prompts?

If `/guides` exists, the extension is loaded.

Guides are active for a normal agent prompt when:

- the extension is loaded,
- `.pi/guides.json` exists and is valid,
- guide resolution succeeds for the current repo,
- and the prompt starts a normal agent turn.

### Why does `/guides` show `guides: off`?

Usually because `.pi/guides.json` does not exist in the current repo.

Run:

```text
/guide-init
```

or create `.pi/guides.json` manually.

### Why does `/guides` show `guides: error`?

Usually because:

- `.pi/guides.json` is invalid,
- the referenced profile does not exist,
- a variant override does not exist,
- a guide file is missing,
- or the config file is inaccessible.

Use `/guides` and inspect the reported reason.

### Do I have to enable the extension separately?

No.

If the package is loaded through `.pi/settings.json` and the package manifest exposes the extension, pi auto-loads it.

### Why would I use `/guide-init` if the package is already loaded?

Because package loading and repo bootstrap are separate concerns.

The package may be available globally, while the repo still lacks:

- `.pi/guides.json`
- `.pi/settings.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

`/guide-init` scaffolds those repo-local files conservatively.

### Does `/guide-profile` create session-only state?

No.

Current v0.1 behavior is persistent repo-local config.
It writes `.pi/guides.json` and reloads the runtime.

Session-scoped overrides are intentionally deferred.

---

## Distribution and ansible expectations

This repository is intended to become the installable pi package source for a broader tooling setup.

The expected distribution model is:

1. this repo publishes the pi package
2. ansible installs the package globally, or ensures it is available
3. consumer repos declare the package in `.pi/settings.json` when they want repo-local reproducibility

Recommended split of responsibility:

- ansible handles package availability and environment setup
- consumer repos handle `.pi/guides.json` and `AGENTS.md`
- the extension handles runtime guide activation

That keeps installation, repo configuration, and runtime behavior cleanly separated.

---

## Why only base TigerStyle for now

This package is being built incrementally.

For the initial pi-native port, only the language-agnostic TigerStyle base has been brought over.
That keeps the contract smaller while the extension, repo activation model, bootstrap flow, and documentation stabilize.

Language-specific TigerStyle variants and broader guide families can be added later without changing the core architecture:

- add guide files
- register them in `registry/guides.json`
- optionally add profiles in `registry/profiles.json`
- document them in this repository

---

## Development notes

When changing any of the following, update the docs and rerun validation:

- `extensions/guide-system.ts`
- `registry/guides.json`
- `registry/profiles.json`
- `templates/repo-AGENTS.md`
- `schemas/*.json`

If you change a contract, document the new behavior in this README.
Keep the template, registry, and runtime logic aligned.
