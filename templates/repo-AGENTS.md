# Repo Agent Context

<!-- BEGIN MANAGED GUIDE HEADER -->
This repository uses the pi guide system.

## Guide Activation Contract

Active guides for this repository are defined in:

- `.pi/guides.json` — canonical machine-readable guide selection
- installed pi guide package extension — resolves and injects active guides into the system prompt

Repo-local `AGENTS.md` supplements the guide system with repository-specific context.
It does not define the canonical active guide set.

## Authoring Rules for This File

Use this file for:

- repository architecture facts
- build, test, and validation commands
- local workflow expectations
- repository-specific constraints
- durable notes that help future tasks in this repo

Do not use this file for:

- reusable cross-repo guide content
- large generic policy documents
- secrets, tokens, or credentials
- machine-readable guide selection state

If a rule should apply across multiple repositories, promote it into the guide package instead of only documenting it here.
